//Problem: It look gross in smaller browser widths and small devices
//Solution: To hide the text links and swap them out with a more appropriate navigation

//create a select element (dropdown) and append to the menu

//Append each page link to the dropdown menu as options
  //create an option element
  //Give selected option the selected property
  //set option's value to the href of the link
  //set option's text to be the same as the link's text
  //append option to dropdown menu

//When an option is selected, change the window to that selected option

//Modify CSS for large screens
  //Hide the dropdown menu

//Modify CSS for small screens
  //Hide the nav links and show the dropdown menu

//update the dropdown menu to show the selected page
