Exercise 2: Saving Your Work

1. Enter "git add <filename>" in your computer's shell (Terminal, Command Prompt, Console)
   This will prepare that file to be saved in your repo's history, permanently,
   as it is right now, just like taking a photo and storing it in a box. This file
   is now on the "stage" because it is "staged to be committed" (ready to be saved)

   - Enter "git add ." to add all the files in your repo that you modified
     since the last time you saved them.

2. Enter "git status" to see all the files that are staged (ready to be committed)

3. Enter 'git commit -m "<message describing your changes>"' to save those staged files.

   - "git commit" takes a photo of all staged files and places it in a box. Your
     repo holds this box of photos. Committing (saving) your work does not replace
     old commits (old photos)--it adds a new commit (new photo). You can view old
     versions of your work (old photos)--we will learn how to do this later.

4. Enter "git push". This saves your box of photos ("version history") to github.com
