Exercise 3: Un-staging Stuff in Git

1. Enter "git add <filename>" to add that file to the stage (ready to be committed)

2. Enter "git status" to view that file on the "stage"

3. Enter "git reset <filename>" in the working directory (the folder with your
   github repo) of your computer's shell.

   - Enter "git reset" to remove all files from the stage

4. Enter "git status". That file is no longer staged to be committed

   - Your console will say "nothing added to commit but untracked files present
     (use "git add" to track)". A "tracked" file means that file is staged
