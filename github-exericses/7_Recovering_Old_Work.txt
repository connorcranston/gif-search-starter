Exercise 7: Recovering Old Work from Version History

1. Enter "git log" to view recent commits. Copy one of those commit IDs. Then
   enter "q" to exit the git log

2. Get the commit id of a version (photo) you'd like to go back to

3. Enter "git reset --hard <commit id>"

   - This will change your version history back to what is was at the commit.
     The "--hard" option will change the files in your directory to match what
     they were during that commit

4. Views your files. They should have changed back to how they were during the
   commit you reset them to
