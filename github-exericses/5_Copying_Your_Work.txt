Exercise 5: Copying Your Work with Branches

1. Enter "git branch test-branch" in the working directory of your computer's shell

2. Enter "git branch"

   - you will see a list of two branches: master and test-branch
   - test-branch is an exact copy of your master branch, which is the default
     branch created with a new repository

3. Enter "git checkout test-branch"

   - the name "test-branch" should now be in parentheses at the end of the
     directory path in your shell. It will turn red when you've modified a file

You can now work on test-branch without affecting master branch. Later, we'll
learn how to add the changes you made in test-branch to master branch

4. Create a new file called "twig.txt" in test-branch

5. Enter "ls". twig.txt will be listed

5. Switch to master branch by entering "git checkout master"

6. Enter "ls". twig.txt is not listed
